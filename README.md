Core Function Highlights
SuperMaker AI Video Production Platform focuses on "intelligent generation + flexible customization" as its core, covering the entire process from content input to finished product output, meeting video creation needs in various scenarios:

Text to Video: Bring Words to "Life"
Through advanced natural language processing technology, text content (such as product copy, teaching scripts, story fragments, etc.) is automatically converted into coherent video scenes. No need to manually design frames; AI will match appropriate materials, scenes, and animations based on text semantics, quickly generating a video draft with narrative logic.
Applicable scenarios: Converting marketing copy to product promotion videos, novel fragments to animated short films, teaching outlines to course videos, etc.
Image to Video: Endow Static Images with Dynamic Vitality
Supports converting single or multiple static images (product pictures, design drafts, photos, etc.) into video sequences with transition effects and dynamic elements. AI intelligently adds camera movements, transition animations, and background ambience, making originally static images vivid and three-dimensional.
Applicable scenarios: Converting e-commerce product images to display videos, travel photos to vlog clips, design works to dynamic demos, etc.
Comprehensive Customization: Create Exclusive Styles

Fine adjustment of basic parameters: Supports custom video resolution (480p, 720p, 1080p), aspect ratio (21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:4, 9:16, 9:21), video length (5s, 10s), and frame rate (16 FPS, 24 FPS), adapting to display needs of different platforms such as Douyin, YouTube, and Moments.
Style and tone customization: Provides multiple preset styles (simple business, lively cartoon, technological sense, retro style, etc.), and also supports customizing color tones, fonts, and special effects to ensure the video highly matches the brand image or creation theme.
Script and storyboard visualization: Built-in AI script assistant tool, which can generate initial scripts based on keywords; meanwhile, supports storyboard preview, allowing creators to clearly control the video rhythm and frame layout before production.

Professional-Grade Post-Production Tools: Enhance Video Quality with One Click

Intelligent editing: Automatically removes redundant fragments, optimizes shot transitions, and also supports manual precise editing to meet personalized needs.
Audio-visual synchronization: Integrates an AI voice generator, which can convert text into voiceovers in multiple styles (male/female/multilingual); paired with AI music recommendation, it matches appropriate background music according to video content to achieve perfect integration of audio and video.
Automatic optimization: AI automatically completes post-processing such as color correction, image stabilization, and light adjustment, making the video present a professional-grade texture.

Efficient Collaboration and Asset Management

Unified material library management: All generated videos, images, and audio materials are automatically saved to the cloud resource library, supporting one-click reuse to reduce repeated production costs.
Team collaboration support: Allows multiple people to edit, comment, and track versions simultaneously, facilitating division of labor among team members and improving creation efficiency.
